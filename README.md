Mwima

Mwima is a research-driven civic and development innovation hub focused on generating evidence, designing solutions, and delivering impact across communities in Africa. We work at the intersection of research, monitoring & evaluation (M&E), capacity building, and design strategy to support data-informed decision-making and sustainable development.
